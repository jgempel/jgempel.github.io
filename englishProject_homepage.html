	  <h2><b>DISCLAIMER</b>: Please read this home page first before exploring the other web pages.
	  The "Getting Started" section contains important information about the safe tasks to do before getting started 
	  in powerlifting.</h2><br/>
	  <h3>What is powerlifting?</h3>
      <p>According to Cambridge Dictionary, powerlifting is "the sport of lifting heavy weights in three different 
	  ways from a standing or lying position.<sup>[1]</sup>" Those "three ways" are the 
	  <b><u>bench press</b></u>, <b><u>deadlift</b></u>, and <b><u>squat</b></u>. This sport places special emphasis
	  on a person's bodily strength, due to its focus on maximum weight. Many absolute beginners of the sport may feel
	  intimidated by the sport's high expectations, or at least the definition of powerlifting. That is why this website
	  aims to help people who have never performed any strength-building exercise before. This site is for the absolute beginner
	  who may not even know or where to start. </p>

	  <p>This image above offers a rudimentary demonstration of the three basic powerlifting exercises.
	     It is true that many variations of these lifts exist. For instance, incline or decline versions of these
		 exercises are popular. People also perform powerlifting exercises with dumbbells, barbells, kettleballs, and
		 the like. It can be tempting and even overwhelming to focus on as many exercises as possible.
		 For this reason, the absolute beginner should not focus on the numerous lift variations that exist.
		 Instead, the beginner should only focus on the bench press, deadlift, and squat by 
		 use of a barbell. Mastering these basic versions of these lifts should occur before moving onto more advanced 
		 exercises.  </p><br/>
	  <h3>Why only focus on the fundamentals?</h3>
	  <p>There are many answers to this question. One definite answer is the risk of injuries that can occur in this sport. 
	     According to Dr. Braunreiter from Houston Methodist, muscle strains in the back, shoulder, and knee are
		 the most common injuries<sup>[3]</sup>. Lower body injuries can occur frequently in powerlifting as well.
		 However, most of these injuries occur due to improper form. The National Library of Medicine also highlights
		 that for every 1000 hours of training, 1.0 to 4.4 injuries occur for the average individual<sup>[4]</sup>.
		 Although that rate may seem low, the average person is almost guaranteed an injury if he or she continues
		 powerlifting for a long time. That is why proper form and technique supersedes attempting to learn
		 too much at once.</p>

	  <h3>What do I need to know before learning each exercise?</h3><br/>
	  <p>To start learning about the sport of powerlifting, it is best to understand these three ideas:
	  <ol>
	    <li><b>Quality is better than quantity.</b> It is recommended that you only perform 5 repetitions 
		of an exercise before taking a break. Performing few repetitions with outstanding form is better than 
		completing many repetitions with mediocre form.</li>
		<li><b>The amount of weight you can lift at first does not matter.</b> It is true that powerlifting focuses on how
		much weight a person can lift. However, the goal for an absolute beginner is not to lift as much as possible.
		The body strength will develop if you continue pursuing this sport. </li>
		<li><b>People's opinions on your lifting abilities do not matter.</b> Every individual who ever powerlifted
		(or performed any human task) has started somewhere. If a person thinks that you are weak because you
		cannot lift as much as another person, then that opinion is simply not the case. In fact, you are 
		<i>already</i> strong because you decided a sport as intimidating as powerlifting. </li>
	  </ol>
	  <h3>Getting Started:</h3><br/>
	  <p>There are a few things that need to be done before starting any exercise:
	  <ol>
	    <li><b>Make sure you are well hydrated.</b> Proper hydration is crucial to minimize the risk of muscle cramps
		in powerlifting, plus it helps you perform better.</li>
		<li><b>Perform some stretches.</b> Stretches loosen up your body's muscles, which can also prevent the
		risk of muscle-related injuries.</li>

		<ul>
		  <li class="nestOne"><b>DISCLAIMER: </b>This website strictly demonstrates the proper way to perform
		  three powerlifting exercises. It does not discuss or demonstrate any stretches. Consult a trainer or 
		  other outside source for this information.</li>
		</ul>
		<li><b>Learn and understand the process of using a barbell.</b> A barbell is a large,
		pole-like structure that must be lifted in some way during a powerlifting exercise. The 
		<b><u>standard weight</b></u> of a barbell is <b><u>45 lbs</b></u>. Each exercise
		has a different lifting strategy. However, the process of setting up a barbell is the same throughout
		all of powerlifting.</li>
		<ol type="a">
		  <li class="nestOne">Each barbell has <b><u>two ends</b></u> in which circular weights become inserted.
		  The weight distribution must always be equal on both sides. For instance, if a 45 lb circular weight
		  is inserted into one end of the barbell, then the other end must also contain a 45 lb weight.</li>
		  <li class="nestOne">It is imperative that you are realistic about how much weight you can safely lift.
		  When adding weight onto the barbell, know and remember the amount that you can lift. If you decide to
		  increase the amount of weight on the barbell, use 5 lb increments on each side. For instance, 
		  a person with 45 lb circular weights on each side of the barbell should add 5 lbs to each side,
		  so that each side equals 50 lbs.
		  <ul>
		    <li class="nestTwo"><b>DISCLAIMER: </b>Absolute beginners should not start lifting for the 
			first time with any circular weights installed on the barbell.</li>
		  </ul></li>
		</ol>
		<li><b>Start setting up the barbell. </b>When loading weight onto a barbell, the barbell's location will vary
		based on the powerlifting exercise.
		<ol type="a">
		  <li class="nestOne">For the <b><u>bench press</b></u>, the weights will be inserted while the barbell
		  is on the exercise bench's <b><u>barbell holder</b></u>. Refer to the "Bench Press" page for an illustration
		  of the exercise bench amd the barbell holder.</li>
		  <li class="nestOne">For the <b><u>deadlift</b></u>, the weights will be inserted while the barbell
		  is on the <b><u>ground</b></u>. </li>
		  <li class="nestOne">For the <b><u>squat</b></u>, the weights will be inserted while the barbell
		  is on the squat rack's <b><u>barbell holder</b></u>. Refer to the "Squats" page for an illustration
		  of the squat rack and the barbell holder.</li>
		</ol>
		<li><b>Finish setting up the barbell by inserting <u>barbell clips</u>. </b>Most barbell clips insert inside
		of the end of the barbell as shown by the GIF below:</li>
		<img src="../englishProject/homepage_pic4.gif" alt="Barbell clip insert">

		  <li class="nestOne"><b>DISCLAIMER: </b>The GIF above shows a general depiction of how to insert
		  a barbell clip into a barbell. Not all barbell clips follow the same process.</li>
